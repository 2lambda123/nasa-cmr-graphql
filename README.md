## About
GraphQL is an api developed by [NASA](http://nasa.gov) [EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov) to search against [Common Metadata Repository (CMR)](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/) concept metadata using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

## Application Installation

Before running the application you'll want to ensure that all necessary packages are installed by running:

    npm install

GraphQL uses a few environment variables for configuring runtime options:

|Variable Name|Default|Description|
|-|:-:|-|
|CMR_ROOT_URL||URL to ping when retrieving metadata e.g. https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov|
|LAMBDA_TIMEOUT|30|Number of seconds to set the Lambda timeout to.|

### Serverless Framework

The local development environment for the static assets can be started by executing the command below in the project root directory:

    serverless offline

This will run the application at [http://localhost:3001/api](http://localhost:3001/api)

## Usage

Currently, this API supports searching and retrieving data for [Collections](#collections), [Granules](#granules), [Services](#services) and [Variables](#variables).

#### Basics

When querying for multiple items there are two high level parameters that can be provided, `count` and `items`. `count` will hold the value returned from the CMR header `CMR-Hits` for the respective concept type. `type` is where you will provide the columns you'd like returned from CMR.

    {
      concept {
        count
        items {
          concept_id
        }
      }
    }

If you're querying single objects `count` is not available and therefore `items` isn't necessary -- you can simply list the columns you'd like returned from CMR as a direct child of your query.

    {
      concept {
        concept_id
      }
    }

Note that the response you get will match the structure of your query, meaning that in the event you've requested data from a list query you'll receive the results in an `items` array whereas with a single query request you will not.


#### Collections

A subset of supported arguments will automatically be sent to immidiately adjacent granule queries, for a list of those arguments see [Passthrough Arguments](#passthrough-arguments).

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/collection.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      collection(concept_id:"C1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        title
        granules {
          count
          items {
            concept_id
            title
          }
        }
        services {
          count
          items {
            concept_id
            type
          }
        }
        variables {
          count
          items {
            concept_id
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      collections(
        concept_id:["C1000000001-EXAMPLE", "C1000000002-EXAMPLE"]
      ) {
		count
        items {
          title
          granules {
            count
            title
          }
          services {
            count
            items {
              concept_id
              type
            }
          }
          variables {
            count
            items {
              concept_id
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

#### Granules

For performance reasons, CMR requires that a collection be provided in order to query granules. While CMR supports multiple aliases for the collection GraphQL requires that it be called `collection_concept_id`; if this is not provided CMR will return an error. We don't enforce this in the schema because you can also use `concept_id` if you're looking for specific granules and schemas don't offer a means of offering conditional validations.

##### Passthrough Arguments

A subset of the supported arguments for [Collections](#collections) will be passed through to the granule query by default. Those arguments are as follows:

- bounding_box
- circle
- point
- polygon
- temporal

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/granules.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      granule(concept_id:"G1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        concept_id
        title
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      granules(collection_concept_id:"G1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        items {
          concept_id
          title
        }
      }
    }


#### Services

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/service.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      service(concept_id:"S1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        concept_id
        type
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      services {
        count
        items {
          concept_id
          type
          description
        }
      }
    }


#### Variables

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/variable.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      variable(concept_id:"V1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        concept_id
        science_keywords
        variable_type
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      variables {
        count
        items {
          concept_id
          science_keywords
          variable_type
        }
      }
    }
